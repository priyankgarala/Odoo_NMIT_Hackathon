# Previous Purchase View Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a complete Previous Purchase View functionality to the Odoo Marketplace application, allowing users to view their order history and purchase details.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Components

1. **Order Model** (`server/src/models/Order.js`)
   - Tracks user purchases with detailed order information
   - Includes order items, pricing, status, and metadata
   - Supports order status tracking (pending, completed, cancelled, shipped, delivered)

2. **Order Service** (`server/src/services/orderServices.js`)
   - `createOrder()` - Creates orders from cart items
   - `getUserOrders()` - Fetches user's order history with pagination
   - `getOrderById()` - Gets specific order details
   - `getUserOrderStats()` - Provides order statistics
   - `getRecentPurchases()` - Gets recent purchase history

3. **Order Controller** (`server/src/controllers/orderController.js`)
   - Handles HTTP requests for order operations
   - Includes proper error handling and validation

4. **Order Routes** (`server/src/routes/orderRoutes.js`)
   - `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
   - `GET /api/orders` - Get user orders (paginated)
   - `GET /api/orders/:orderId` - Get specific order
   - `GET /api/orders/stats/summary` - Get order statistics
   - `GET /api/orders/recent/purchases` - Get recent purchases

### Frontend Components

1. **PreviousPurchasePage** (`client/src/pages/PreviousPurchasePage.jsx`)
   - Displays order history with pagination
   - Shows order statistics (total orders, total spent, etc.)
   - Order detail modal for viewing individual order items
   - Responsive design with modern UI

2. **Order API Client** (`client/src/api/order.js`)
   - Client-side functions for interacting with order endpoints
   - Handles API calls for all order operations

3. **Navigation Integration**
   - Added "Previous Purchases" link to header navigation
   - Protected route requiring user authentication

4. **Checkout Integration**
   - Updated CartPage with working checkout functionality
   - Creates orders from cart items and redirects to purchase history
